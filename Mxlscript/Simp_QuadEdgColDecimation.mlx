  <Param value="10000" type="RichInt" description="Target number of faces" tooltip="The desired final number of faces." name="TargetFaceNum"/>

  <Param value="1" type="RichFloat" description="Quality threshold" tooltip="Quality threshold for penalizing bad shaped faces.&lt;br>The value is in the range [0..1]&#xa; 0 accept any kind of face (no penalties),&#xa; 0.5  penalize faces with quality &lt; 0.5, proportionally to their shape&#xa;" name="QualityThr"/>

  <Param value="1" type="RichFloat" description="Boundary Preserving Weight" tooltip="The importance of the boundary during simplification. Default (1.0) means that the boundary has the same importance of the rest. Values greater than 1.0 raise boundary importance and has the effect of removing less vertices on the border. Admitted range of values (0,+inf). " name="BoundaryWeight"/>

  <Param value="false" type="RichBool" description="Preserve Topology" tooltip="Avoid all the collapses that should cause a topology change in the mesh (like closing holes, squeezing handles, etc). If checked the genus of the mesh should stay unchanged." name="PreserveTopology"/>
  <Param value="true" type="RichBool" description="Optimal position of simplified vertices" tooltip="Each collapsed vertex is placed in the position minimizing the quadric error.&#xa; It can fail (creating bad spikes) in case of very flat areas. &#xa;If disabled edges are collapsed onto one of the two original vertices and the final mesh is composed by a subset of the original vertices.

  <Param value="false" type="RichBool" description="Weighted Simplification" tooltip="Use the Per-Vertex quality as a weighting factor for the simplification. The weight is used as a error amplification value, so a vertex with a high quality value will not be simplified and a portion of the mesh with low quality values will be aggressively simplified." name="QualityWeight"/>
